# Light Chaser V3 Security Review Response

## Low

### 1. Solidity version 0.8.20 won't work on all chains due to PUSH0

Acknowledged. ERC721 uses `mcopy`, so 0.8.25 is required, as is EVM Cancun.

## NonCritical

### 1. Floating pragma should be avoided

This is a library rather than a final contract, so floating pragma is preferred.

### 2. Explicitly define visibility of functions to prevent misconceptions on what can access the function

These are only free functions, so visibility is disallowed by the compiler.

### 3. Assembly block creates dirty bits

The lack of 'memory-safe' modifiers to assembly blocks is due to overwriting the upper bits of the free memory pointer.

The upper bits are restored to zero but truth be told, I have no idea if this techincally violates the memory-safe ruleset because the documentation does not specify this edge case and memory-safe violations is undefined behavior. So in abundance of caution, memory-safe will only be used where it is guaranteed to not violate the ruleset.

### 4. .call bypasses function existence check, type checking and argument packing

There are nonzero returndatasize checks on calls to validate the contract's existence (except erc20 due to USDT). There is some indirection here by deferring checks for gas optimization though.

In either case, acknowledged.

### 5. Missing events in sensitive functions

This only triggered once and most functions are technically stateful in that an external call is made, though the types never mutate local storage. This may be a false positive.

### 6. All verbatim blocks are considered identical by deduplicator and can incorrectly be unified

There is no verbatim block I'm aware of.

### 7. Avoid using 'owner' or '\_owner' as a parameter name

Good point, though `owner` in most cases is a reference to the specification. Will review.

### 8. Memory-safe annotation missing

These hits appear to be on assembly blocks with no memory access. Is this still required without memory accesses? The documentation doesn't clearly say one way or the other.

## Gas

### 1. Assembly let var only used on once

There are a few cases of this that went unnoticed, though the optimizer inlines these variables.

However, it's worth noting that the hit this tool generated points to a free memory pointer access before overwriting it. ie the following procedures _must_ be in this exact order and the variable _must_ be assigned if only once for the sake of restoring the free memory pointer. It may be worth adding a check to handle cases where the expressions between the variable assignment and variable usage affect the data location from which the variable originates.

```solidity
let fmp := mload(0x40)

// -- snip

mstore(0x24, receiver)

mstore(0x44, tokenId)

// -- snip

mstore(0x40, fmp)
```
